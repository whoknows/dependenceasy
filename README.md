# Dependenceasy
Easy way to manage javascript dependencies.

Goal :
 - only github url dependencies
 - version or branch
 - git clone to install dependency (to be able to develop inside the installed dependencies)
 - multiples files for differents environments (dependencies.prod.json, dependencies.dev.json, etc.)
 - recursive dependency management (for later)
